Minesweeper
===========

This is a project I was given during the second year of university, in which the task was to create a fully featured minesweeper game using Java.

Rules: 

To win, flag all mines present on the board, you will have the same amount of flags as there is mines.

The score is dictated by how many moves you have made, things such as using a hint, removing a flag, placing a flag and revealing a square all count as moves.

The hint button shows a hint as a green border to show that the cell is not mined

When a square is revealed it will show a number, this is the number of mines in squares adjacent to that cell, use this to try and guess where the mines are.

Also included is the source for a text-based interface. Type in commands to perform the action, or type help to show all available commands.
